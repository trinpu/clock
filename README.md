# A clock

This piece was inspired by the  Circular Echoes by the Squidgroup (here is the [exhibition link](https://www.lostinlight.uk/)). The original installation was a circle created by lights and speakers, programmed with many behaviors. The piece made me reflect on two concepts:

* The idea of passing time
* How easy it is to manipulate digital objects
* The idea of how things may be similar, although they appear different

These reflections prompted me to build a clock. One that starts with a standard structure and progressively changes towards a more random and diverse configuration. Hope you enjoy!
