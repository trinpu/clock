# A clock

This piece was inspired by the  Circular Echoes by the Squidgroup. The original installation was a circle created by lights and speakers. The piece made me reflect on two concepts:

* The idea of passing time
* How easy it is to manipulate digital objects
* The idea of how things that may be similar, although they are appear different

These reflections prompted me to build a clock. One that starts with a standard structure, and that progressively changes towards more random and diverse configuration. Hope you enjoy.
